paragraph_1: "I'm {{ age }} years old and live in Horsens with my partner and my bonus daughter. Family life is deeply important to me, and I believe in finding a balance between creativity and technical thinking – both in my work and in my everyday life."
paragraph_2: "When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me sketching. I love drawing, being creative, and tinkering with electronics and low-voltage circuits – especially anything that lights up or blinks. It's the joy of building things, making them work, and bringing them to life that drives me – whether it’s through code or copper wire."
paragraph_3: "I'm curious by nature, detail-oriented, and at my best when I get to think, design, and create."
